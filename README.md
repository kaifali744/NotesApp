# NotesApp üìù

NotesApp is an Android application that allows users to register, log in, and create personal journals. The app uses Firebase Authentication for secure login and registration, and stores journal entries, including images, titles, and descriptions. The entries are displayed in a RecyclerView, each represented as a CardView with a timestamp of when the journal was added.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Register and log in using email and password through Firebase Authentication.
- **Add Journal**: Users can create a journal entry by uploading an image, entering a title, and adding a description.
- **Journal Display**: After adding a journal, the user is redirected to a display activity where all journals are shown in a RecyclerView. Each journal is presented as a CardView with:
  - An image (uploaded by the user)
  - Title
  - Description
  - Timestamp indicating when the journal was added
- **Future Enhancements**: Plans to add Google and Facebook authentication.
